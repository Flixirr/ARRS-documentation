      We need to fake preparatiS0RVU2F6bV for additional escR3RWY5M3BN routes, to bait Bears out of main plOW9XWTg3R. <br>
      I don’t know the main plans, just this one missWxUYUJaSEJJ. One route, a couple evac points, soubjAxMzlaUVk4d like a real deal. <br>
      Except. My buddy from higher commXdtOENkTmdjS had told me somethTI0MldjL0s1Q0R strange “I can’t say what will happen, but you will know. Once it happens, everyone for himself”. <br>

      That was our last encounGphRndmWVAx. We have won the batdXNIVkpYeTBW. We had fought well, fiercQ3l2Tjk5ZXdPZ1, with all we had, I know. <br>
      But that was not enoMyVnZXU2d2b0R. Not today. <br>
      It hurts to leave like that, withZK1c0aHk0ZGNa proper goodbye. The injurMVFmc1hNWHZ0 don't hurt as much. <br>
      PresK01UWThCUE8y lost his arm and is pretty much fading. He has fear in his eyes. It is the fear of the unknUnowYWlaSzc4 and inevitable. We usually postp... it, thinking we have time. He had met it much earlier. <br>
      Animal is bleed..., speaking of valhalla. I think he would be glad to be in hell, there are plenty of people to fight with. I don’t know if he even reali... his own state. <br>
      I also got some shrapnel under my vest. It burns, but, at the same time feels numb. I’m slowly losing control over my body. <br>
      This is it for us. <br>
